# Algorithm implementations

Algorithm implementation exercises in multiple languages.

This also has its share on implementations of *data structures*.

**Note on namespaces**

Although it is know that on Java, and similar namespaced languages, to
never put classes on the *default package*, implementations here will not
follow this best practice since the main interest is on the algorithm
implementations and not in the correct organization of its enclosing
elements.
